## PID Controller Project

### Introduction

In this project, we will implement a PID Controller in C++ to race around the lake track.

This project examines the Twiddle method for tuning PID parameters. PID is the most common type of regulator within control theory, partly because itâ€™s relatively simple and yields stable results for most applications. The
p, i and d parameters vary for each application; therefore, choosing the right parameters
is crucial for obtaining good results but also somewhat difficult. The experiments demonstrate the power of Twiddle to solve the problem of tuning PID parameters without getting stuck in local minimums.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Use the simulator to get CTE, speed
* Implement a PID Controller
* Tune the PID controller
* Test that the controlller successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Project Resources

we need simulator to complete the PID Controller Project.

* [Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) download the most recent version

The simulator will provide the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

The speed limit of the simulator has been increased from 30 mph to 100 mph. Get ready to channel your inner Vin Diesel and try to drive SAFELY as fast as possible, we don't have to meet a minimum speed to pass.

I am running the driving simulator on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with 800x600 resolution and fantastic quality.


### Twiddle Algorithm

**Implementation**



Here is some pythonic pseudo code. evaluator is an algorithm that returns an error.

```python
# Choose an initialization parameter vector
p = [0, 0, 0]
# Define potential changes
dp = [1, 1, 1]
# Calculate the error
best_err = evaluator(*p)
tol = 0.001
while sum(dp) > tol:
    for i, _ in enumerate(p):
        # first try to increase param
        p[i] += dp[i]
        err = evaluator(*p)
        if err < best_err:
            # Increasing param reduced error, so record and continue to increase dp range.
            best_err = err
            dp[i] *= 1.1
        else:
            # Otherwise, increased error, so undo and try decreasing dp
            p[i] -= 2.*dp[i]
            err = evaluator(*p)
            if err < best_err:
                # Decreasing param reduced error, so record and continue to increase dp range.
                best_err = err
                dp[i] *= 1.1
            else:
                # Otherwise, reset param and reduce dp range.
                p[i] += dp[i]
                dp[i] *= 0.9
```


If the sum of D params is still larger than our tolerance we initially have as 0.001 and they go through all the parameters sequentially.

I increment that by D params by 1.1, find out what the eror is, if the error is better than our best error, which i initialize with the initial error and i keep the best error and even increment D params by 1.1. Otherwise, I try the other direction. One find out the error, if that succeeds, i keep it and increment D params. Or restore old parameters and decrease D params by 0.9.



### Tuning PID Parameters


Tuning PID controllers is normally done through trial and error, but it is possible to analytically calculate what the gain values should be. However, this requires a good knowledge of the mechanics of the system and is beyond the scope of this article. It is important to only vary one parameter at a time so that the effects on the metric graph in the training scenario are not obscured.
Once the desired characteristics are determined, the following sequence is recommended for tuning the controllers:
1. Set all gains (K) to 0 and increase Kp until the system behaves in a desirable manner with no overshoot or oscillation. Tuning this value first is advisable, as it will generally have the biggest effct on the output.2. Increase Ki to eliminate the steady-state error.3. Adjust Kd to reduce any overshoot or reduce the settling time as required.

As a general rule, if the system is unable to reach its desired value, increase Ki. If it oscillates, reduce Kp and Ki. If it is too slow to change, then increase Kd.

A summary of how the three parts of a PID controller affect various aspects of the output


| Response       | Rise time            | Overshoot   | Setting time         | Steady-state error     |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------|
| Kp             | Decrease             | Increase    | Minor                | Decrease               |
| Ki             | Decrease             | Increase    | Increase             | Removes                |
| Kd				| Minor	              | Decrease    | Decrease             | Minor                  |


The simulator provides the actual speed of the controlled car and the crosstrack error(CTE), to calculate the actions on the steering wheel, the accelerator and the brake. Two Proportional-Integral- Derivative (PID) self-tuning controller are employed, one for controlling the direction, the other for controlling the accelerator-brake.

I implement the twiddle algorithm to tune the parameters Kp, Ki and Kd of the PID controller, initialize all gains(K) with zero and the potential changes that we want to probe.

The performance index, The Integral of Squared Error(ISE) is utilized to tune PID controller, achieve the desired speed and steer angle.


| PV             | dKp                  | dKi         | dKd             |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| steering       | 0.04                 | 0.0004      | 1               |
| speed          | 0.2                  | 0.0001      | 0.4             |

Here are my final hyperparameters:

| PV             | Kp                   | Ki          | Kd              |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| steering       | 0.112403             | 0.00125197  | 2.88999         |
| speed          | 0.968039             | 0.00026506  | 2.59908         |

The steering angle, throttle and crosstrack error(CTE) are shown in below Figure.
